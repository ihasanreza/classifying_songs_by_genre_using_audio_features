# Classifying songs by genre using audio features

This project aims to classify songs into their respective genres using machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Data

The data for this project consists of audio features and genre labels for a dataset of songs.

## Methodology

We used a combination of feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and machine learning algorithms (logistic regression and decision tree) to develop and compare models for song classification. The models were trained and tested using K-fold cross-validation.

## Results

The final models achieved good performance on the classification task, with a mean accuracy of approximately 78% for logistic regression and 76% for decision tree classification.
